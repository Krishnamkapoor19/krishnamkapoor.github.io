## About Me

Hi, I’m Krishnam Kapoor, a BBA (Finance) graduate building competence in equity research, valuation, and driver-based financial modeling.

This page is dedicated to independent financial analysis and structured writing. I aim to connect raw data with rigorous modeling to derive supportable conclusions about company value. I use this platform to share my latest models and research notes for review and discussion.

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in connecting to talk about finance or the markets.
